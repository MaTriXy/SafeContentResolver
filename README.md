# SafeContentResolver

A replacement for Android's [`ContentResolver`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentResolver.html)
that protects against the *Surreptitious Sharing* attack.

## Surreptitious Sharing

Read all about it in the [corresponding blog post](https://www.ibr.cs.tu-bs.de/news/ibr/surreptitious-sharing-2016-04-04.xml).

## Usage

Replace all occurrences of [`ContentResolver.openInputStream()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/ContentResolver.html#openInputStream(android.net.Uri))
where URIs provided by other apps are opened with `SafeContentResolver.openInputStream()`.

`SafeContentResolver` will refuse to open `file://` URIs pointing to files belonging to your app and `content://` URIs
belonging to content providers of your app.  
If you wish to allow access to certain content providers, add the following `<meta-data>` element to the appropriate
`<provider>` entries in your manifest:
```xml
<provider â€¦ >
    <meta-data
        android:name="de.cketti.safecontentresolver.ALLOW_INTERNAL_ACCESS"
        android:value="true" />
</provider>
```

The library comes in two flavors `safe-content-resolver-v14` and `safe-content-resolver-v21`. The former includes
native code to be able to invoke the `fstat` system call that is used to retrieve the owner of a file. Starting with
Lollipop (API 21) the framework includes the class [`Os`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/system/Os.html)
to access this functionality. So `safe-content-resolver-v21` is free of native code and thus much smaller.

To retrieve an instance of `SafeContentResolver` use:
```java
SafeContentResolver safeContentResolver = SafeContentResolverCompat.newInstance(context);
```

If your `minSdkVersion` is 21 or higher you only need to include `safe-content-resolver-v21` and use the following code:
```java
SafeContentResolver safeContentResolver = SafeContentResolver.newInstance(context);
```

## Include the library

```groovy
compile 'de.cketti.safecontentresolver:safe-content-resolver-v14:0.1.0'
```

Or, if you're using `minSdkVersion` 21 or higher:

```groovy
compile 'de.cketti.safecontentresolver:safe-content-resolver-v21:0.1.0'
```

## Native code

`safe-content-resolver-v14` contains native code for the following ABIs:
* armeabi
* armeabi-v7a
* arm64-v8a
* x86
* x86_64
* mips
* mips64

If you don't want to include all of them in your APK you might want to look into
[ABIs Splits](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide/apk-splits#TOC-ABIs-Splits).
